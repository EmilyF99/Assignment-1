                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <h4>Written 18/12/2020</h4>
                <p>The following is a personal reflection on my experience making this website.</p>
                <p>This is the one of the first projects I have coded, it is the first project I have made using HTML and CSS.</p>
                <p>In that respect I think this project has gone quite well and I have been successful in my task of making a portfolio website.</p>

                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <h4>Written 18/12/2020</h4>
                <p>My overall thoughts on this project is that it was a success.</p>
                <p>I have mostly felt positive throughout this project and managed to create this project without too much difficulty.</p>
                <p>However I do think I have made the project to the best of my abilites and to the reach of my knowledge.</p>
                <p>I think my website has achieved my main goal, to make a professional looking website within my abilities.</p>
                <p>I believe that I have coded and commented in a way that means in the future I will be able to come back to this project and expand it in the future.</p>
                <p>I think I have managed to show a range of skills in website creation with this website as I have used grids, forms, classes, transform, transition, and Id's.</p>
                <p>However I do think that I could have used Forms more efficently. My form is currently short as it only uses a submit button to externally link to Gmail.</p>
                <p>I do think if I had more time I could have been more creative with some elements of this project, such as making my own images and graphics rather than taking some from Google.</p>
                <p>I think my layout and design for this website was effective, I was going for a portfolio business card type of effect and I feel like this has been achieved well.</p>
                <p>The reason I think this is because the text is not clutured on the website and it is not tiring to read, this was achieved by sepearting text and making more pages than defined on the brief. </p>

                <h3>Feelings</h3>
                <h4>Written 18/12/2020</h4>
                <p>I feel a lot more confident with my coding skills than I did before. Before I felt like I may not have the skills to complete this project due to lack of coding experience.</p>
                <p>The reason I feel more confident is because I noticed that the more I worked on the website the faster my coding abilities became implying that I was developing a better understanding and therefore able to work faster.</p>
                <p>I also feel like my ability has improved a when I went over my work to add addtional comments, during this process I was able to fine and remove lots of reduant code that was either not used or created actions that worked against each other.</p>
                <p>Reflectively while I acknowledged that the project was within my abilities there was a few times I was frustrated with the project. This was mainly around trying to get the mobile menu to work using CSS, I found this task particularly difficult and solved it using trial and error ratherh than understanding what should be classed and what shouldn't.  </p>
                <p>I also feel like I need to review the lecturers content in regards to GitHub, this is because I didn't use branches when making my commits. Some may argue because this website is quite small in sizes of code that it is not necessaryto make branches however I do see the use of them. I tried to make branches on my inital commits however I made a mistake in how I was using them and they wan't working correctly so they were deleted and I didn't realise until I was quite a few comments into my work.</p>
                <p>I feel like my website is fairly easy to navigate and use. This was due to it's simple style and layout. I feel like I could have been more creative with my website, however this may have had the consequence of making it harder to use</p>
                <p>I feel like the design of my website is good in terms of font useage, I feel like the fonts I picked from Google fonts are wasy to read and appropriate in terms of size. I chose a serif font for the navigation bar to make it stand out from the main content of the site and to give it a more traditional look (Roboto-Slab). However I think the use of the Poppins font for the main content was a good decision as it was Sans-serif which makes it easier to read in general, especially in a smaller size and in a block of text, which was it's main use.</p>
