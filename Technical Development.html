                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <h4>Written 28/12/2020</h4>
                <p>This section of the site report will cover the development of the sites code and how my code has devloped to the current site.</p>
                <p>Rather than making a step by step process of my codes development I will be showing my codes morphology by breaking it down into sections and then discussing how the isolated code for that section developed. This is because my code did not develop in straightforward sections.Some of the sections were completed all in one go, like forms and static layout. However other parts such as grid and fixes were done over time and at no specific stage. I prefered to fix things as I went rather than all at once at the end. This is because I personally struggle to fix everything at a set end point as it can become confusing to know what piece of code is not working as intended. Especially if the problem relates to logic issues rather than syntax issues as it is not as easy to highlight the option. </p>

                <h4>Inital Page Creation</h4>
                <h4>Written 29/12/2020</h4>
                <p>The very first thing I did when making the site was to create all the pages I need and add the skeleton HTML to the site. The skeleton is everything that is needed on a HTML file everytime you create one.</p>

                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Skeleton 2.png" class="HTMLSkeleton2" alt="Screenshot of HTML Skeleton 2">
                <p>To start my code I added the basic sections that my site must have, these were the doctype tag, html tag, head tag and body tag. These are a must so I did a commit after this step to ensure that I had a base saved. On my next commit I added additional essential information to the HTML. Such as the charset and the language options, these are set on a default, however they are important to add in case the users browser assumes a different default and as a result my page displays incorrectly.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Skeleton 3.png" class="HTMLSkeleton3" alt="Screenshot of HTML Skeleton 3">
                <p>In screen shot three code has been added to make the beginnings of my website. Important areas were marked with placholder text to help me create the static layout. Adding the text to sections allows me to see where exactly that section is going to be drawn and how the text displays. I also created a list of all my initial pages needed so I could start to create a navigation bar. I also added links below the sites title. These links are stylesheets and are directly connected to my CSS pages, of which they are three. There is the default CSS which applies CSS that is consistent across both mobile and desktop layouts, such as colours. The other two CSS files are mobile and desktop. These have sizes assigned to them so the users browser knows which version of the site to display. With the min and max width attribute the site changes side once it reachers over eight hundred pixels. Once over this number the site will display the CSS for desktop and under this number it will display the mobile site.This number was selected to accomdate for the largest of mobile phones and for small tablets. </p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Skeleton 4.png" class="HTMLSkeleton4" alt="Screenshot of HTML Skeleton 4">
                <p>In my fourth screen shot there is a different skeleton CSS full of placeholders. This was because I wanted to focus on getting the static layout of my site working completely on one page rather than all at once. This is a more efficent way of working as once you've got one page to your liking you can copy the code from on page to another to have two pages that work correctly. If I made all the pages at the same time then everytime I changed a line of code on one then I would have to change it on the other four pages, this would make the pages take much longer to complete. Therefore this layout was created to ensure when I was testing the navigation bar later on I could see where the navigation bar was directing to.</p>
