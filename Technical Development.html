                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <h4>Written 28/12/2020</h4>
                <p>This section of the site report will cover the development of the sites code and how my code has devloped to the current site.</p>
                <p>Rather than making a step by step process of my codes development I will be showing my codes morphology by breaking it down into sections and then discussing how the isolated code for that section developed. This is because my code did not develop in straightforward sections.Some of the sections were completed all in one go, like forms and static layout. However other parts such as grid and fixes were done over time and at no specific stage. I prefered to fix things as I went rather than all at once at the end. This is because I personally struggle to fix everything at a set end point as it can become confusing to know what piece of code is not working as intended. Especially if the problem relates to logic issues rather than syntax issues as it is not as easy to highlight the option. </p>

                <h3>Inital Page Creation</h3>
                <h4>Written 29/12/2020</h4>
                <h4>Code written 09/11/2020</h4>
                <p>The very first thing I did when making the site was to create all the pages I need and add the skeleton HTML to the site. The skeleton is everything that is needed on a HTML file everytime you create one.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Skeleton 1.png" class="HTMLSkeleton1" alt="Screenshot of HTML Skeleton 1">
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Skeleton 2.png" class="HTMLSkeleton2" alt="Screenshot of HTML Skeleton 2">
                <p>To start my code I added the basic sections that my site must have, these were the doctype tag, html tag, head tag and body tag. These are a must so I did a commit after this step to ensure that I had a base saved. On my next commit I added additional essential information to the HTML. Such as the charset and the language options, these are set on a default, however they are important to add in case the users browser assumes a different default and as a result my page displays incorrectly.</p>
                <h4>Code written 27/11/2020</h4>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Skeleton 3.png" class="HTMLSkeleton3" alt="Screenshot of HTML Skeleton 3">
                <p>In screen shot three code has been added to make the beginnings of my website. Important areas were marked with placholder text to help me create the static layout. Adding the text to sections allows me to see where exactly that section is going to be drawn and how the text displays. I also created a list of all my initial pages needed so I could start to create a navigation bar. I also added links below the sites title. These links are stylesheets and are directly connected to my CSS pages, of which they are three. There is the default CSS which applies CSS that is consistent across both mobile and desktop layouts, such as colours. The other two CSS files are mobile and desktop. These have sizes assigned to them so the users browser knows which version of the site to display. With the min and max width attribute the site changes side once it reachers over eight hundred pixels. Once over this number the site will display the CSS for desktop and under this number it will display the mobile site.This number was selected to accomdate for the largest of mobile phones and for small tablets. </p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Skeleton 4.png" class="HTMLSkeleton4" alt="Screenshot of HTML Skeleton 4">
                <p>In my fourth screen shot there is a different skeleton HTML full of placeholders. This was because I wanted to focus on getting the static layout of my site working completely on one page rather than all at once. This is a more efficent way of working as once you've got one page to your liking you can copy the code from on page to another to have two pages that work correctly. If I made all the pages at the same time then everytime I changed a line of code on one then I would have to change it on the other four pages, this would make the pages take much longer to complete. Therefore this layout was created to ensure when I was testing the navigation bar later on I could see where the navigation bar was directing to.</p>

                <h3>Developing Static Layouts</h3>
                <h4>Written 30/12/2020</h4>
                <h4>Code written 27/11/2020</h4>
                <p>I started my static layout by making three CSS stylesheets. These stylesheets all have the same name as the homepage links.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\CSS Default Skeleton.png" class="CSSDefaultSkeleton" alt="Starting default CSS skeleton">
                <p>I started first with the default CSS stylesheet, on this stylesheet I added grid areas and the default colours for the page. The default page has this information because the grid areas and colours are consistent across all the pages. Putting them into default CSS means this code does not have to be repeated into both the mobile and desktop CSS. If I just had two stylesheets there would be a lot of repeated code.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\CSS Desktop Skeleton.png" class="CSSDesktopSkeleton" alt="Starting Desktop CSS skeleton">
                <img src="Code Morphology\CSS Mobile.png" class="CSSMobileSkeleton" alt="Starting Mobile CSS skeleton">
                <p>I then started adding a grid layout to my site. A grid layout allows for a responsive design that changes depending on the users window size, grid layout also makes aligning page elements easier as you don't have to position each element individually. I have used HTML sections rather than classes to start with, this is to make the site up to current HTML5 standards (citation needed). It is important to note that at this stage this commit does not have the correct code in it. My grid code is correct however I have added CSS to size the elements individually. This would override the grid layout and result in my grid not being drawn correctly. You can see the effect of this because my grid sizes do not look like the correct percentages to draw a design like in my wireframe. There is also a problem with the units that are used on the heights and widths. The header in the first set of code has a percentage and a view width assigned to it, which is not correct and can result in different sizings. </p>
                <p>The mobile top part of the code is a new class, this is a seperate class to make it easy to understand what it does. This class is used to draw the top marroon box that is used to hold the burger menu on the mobile site. On the desktop site this is set to display none as it is not used on that version of the site. </p>
                <h4>Code written 02/12/2020</h4>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Index page 2nd December.png" class="Indexpage0212-1" alt="Adding the sub-navigation bar">
                <p>In my original design there was a sub-navigation bar, in this stage I added the text for this. I also added the empty href links for this. These will be used to link all the other sites pages to each other and create a working navigation bar for the desktop site.  </p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Index page 2nd December part two.png" class="Indexpage0212-2" alt="Replacing placeholders on Index page">
                <p>After this step I removed the placeholder text from the index page. I then replaced this with the final content I wanted on the site. I then added a incomplete image link to the site with the alt text set. Originally I had teh height and width set in the HTML, later on this will be removed and the sizing will be changed to the CSS. This is because I required different sizes for both the mobile and the desktop site.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Index page 2nd December part three .png" class="Indexpage0212-3" alt="Linking additional pages to the navigation bar">
                <p>Then I went back to the navigation bar and added the relative links to the other pages. These relative links mean that when the text on the link is clicked the user will be taken to that page.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Desktop CSS 2nd of december .png" class="desktopCSS0212" alt="Removing the header section from CSS">
                <p>Originally I had the titles in a seperate section for the page. However this became complicated and redudant. Instead of this I replaced the header section by just using head tags instead as I found this easier to work with, especially considering I would need multiple header sections.As I was no longer using the header tags I removed them from the HTML and CSS as shown in this screenshot.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Site Display 0212.png" class="siteDisplay0212" alt="How my site looked on the second of December">
                <p>My site at this point in time does not display properly. However at this stage in time that was not my intention. My intention at this point in time was to get some of the basic CSS down to see whether my site was linked together correctly and whether the CSS I had added at that moment was correct and adding something to the site.</p>
                <p>The issues with this page currently are with the navigation menu. Currently the aside draws in the correct place but the navigation draws as one complete marroon bar across the top with blocks of the submenu appearing underneath. At the moment my navigation bar is displaying vertically rather than horizontally.</p>
                <h4>Code written 03/12/2020</h4>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Index page 3rd December.png" class="Indexpage0312-1" alt="Adding the font to the webpage">
                <p>Next I added the Google Fonts links to the top of the Index page where the rst of the stylesheets are located. This code is not my own and was copied from the links that Google Fonts provides.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Index page 3rd December part two.png" class="Indexpage0312-2" alt="Commenting out the submenu">
                <p>After this stage I considered my submenu, I commented out the submenu as I was considering whether I really needed a submenu on my site. Evenutally I would decide that I don't need a submenu. This was because the contents of my pages are self-explanatory so the submenu was not adding any additional content to the site and would result in it looking a little more cluttered. </p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Index page 3rd December part three.png" class="Indexpage0312-3" alt="Added more text and image link to Index page">
                <p>After this point I added the image link for my picture as well as assigning it a class so that I could add CSS to it. At this point in time I have still not removed the sizing from the HTML so this code is not correct at the momement.</p>
                <p>Not a lot of HTML was changed at this stage, this was because my focus at this stage was to get the site to look like my wireframe, therefore most of the changes at this stage were to the sites CSS.                                   </p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Default Css December 3rd.png" class="defaultCSS0312" alt="Changes to the default CSS on the 3rd of December">
                <img src="Code Morphology\CSS Default Site Display December 3rd.png" class="siteDisplay0312" alt="How my site looked after updating the default CSS">
                <p>On the default CSS one of the biggest changes was applying the Google Fonts I had selected to the sections I have made.The CSS for this was provided by Google Fonts. I then realigned each section to have the text in each one centred as a default as I thought this would suit my site design.THe navigation bar default code is split into two parts, the nav section and teh li section. The nav section has incorrect code in it, this section has code that should be in the li section instead, such as list-style: none; and text-decoration:none;. This code is in the wrong place as the nav tag does not have the text for the navigation bar inside it. That is stored in the li tag. The li tag has the same code in it as the nav tag as well as the colour white assigned to it. This is because black text would not show up well on the marroon colour.</p>
                <p>I fixed a few issues with my code at this stage. My grid  area for the main section was incorrect on my old CSS. On this update I changed this to the correct title which will help to fix my problems I was having with grid. I had the CSS for the main asigned to the grid area aside. This would result in nothing being applied to the main section and two lots of code being applied to the CSS. This explained why on my last screen shot why the aside was showing and the main section was not. I also changed the background colour of the nav section. Originally this was a marroon colour. However this would result in the whole of the navigation bar being a marroon section, like in the previous commit. Rather than have cream in the background and the marroon colour only surrounding the list elements.</p>
                <p>The screenshow next to it shows what effect the default CSS changes have had on the site.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Desktop CSS 3rd december.png" class="desktopCSS0312" alt="Changes made on my desktop CSS for the 3rd of December">
                <img src="Code Morphology\Desktop CSS 3rd december part two.png" class="desktopCSS0312-2" alt="Changes made on my desktop CSS for the 3rd of December">
                <img src="Code Morphology\CSS Desktop Site Display December 3rd.png" class="desktopsitedisplay0312" alt="How my site looks with teh changes to my CSS.">
                <p>Next I altered the desktop CSS. I first altered my grid again. I noticed the percentages I used did not add up to 100%, this could result in my page overhanging and needing a horizontal scroll bar which would look clumsy and not be user friendly. I then added a negative margin in the body tag. This was to fix a problem I was having with the border of my website. There was a white bar on the top and to the left of my site. I', sure the negative margin approach is probably not the best way to tackle this problem but for now acts as a quick fix. I also added a height to the main and aside section. However this would later be removed as it contradicts the grid code I added. I then added a 2em  padding to the top of the main and aside section. The padding was added to seperate elements on the page to make the site easier to read and give break points for the user when they are reading the site.  </p>
                <p>Next I started working on my navigation bar. In the nav tag I added display-inline:block;. Then in my li element I added a float left. This will seperate the list items and get them to display in a horizontal line. I then added padding around each li element. This will result in a marroon box being draw around each piece of text. this will act as a navigation button. I then added a margin of 1em to the li elements. This results in the li elements being seperated from each other. This makes it clear where each navigation bar button ends so there is not the risk of the user miss-clicking on the wrong part of the nav bar and then being confused on where the link has taken them. Lastly I then added a box shadow to the li elements. This results in a grey shadow being added to each side of the box, this helps it stand out from the page. The box shadows was sourced from this book...(citation needed)</p>
                <p>The last changed added to this site was to make the picture round. This looks a little more refined than a square picture with no effects on it. This was sourced from this book..(insert citation).</p>
                <p>The screenshot next to the code shows how this code has effected the site.</p>
                <h4>Code written 10/12/2020</h4>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Index page 1012.png" class="Indexpage1012" alt="Changes to Index page 10th December">
                <p>At this point in time I felt like the top of my site looked a little empty and uninteresting. In order to combat this I added an extra box that acts like a footer next to my nav bar. I did not think the footer section would have been a good label to give this as a traditional footer appears at the bottom of the screen, there I made a custom class for this. </p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\CV Page 1012.png" class="CV1012" alt="Adding Content to my CV page">
                <p>Happy with progress I was making with my index page I then copied across to code from that page and added the content I wanted for that page. I also added a placeholder image to that page to help me with positioning later.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Default CSS 1012.png" class="defaultCSS1012" alt="Default CSS changes made on the 10th of December">
                <p>On my default CSS I added a wild card (*) to my code, this sets the page styling to a default. The reason I added this wildcard is not only is it good practice but it also removes the hyperlinked appearance of my navigation bar, which I was having trouble removing, as well as trying to remedy the problem I had with the margins of the site.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Desktop CSS 1012.png" class="desktopCSS1012" alt="Desktop CSS changes made on the 10th of December">
                <p>I then adjusted my grid again, this time I set the columns to auto as I felt this would improve the responsiveness of the website. I then adjusted the template areas to include the new top footer I had created. However my code at this stage was incorrect, my class has a different name to the one included in the grid, therefore the grid would not be able to add the footer.</p>
                <p>I then adjusted the padding under the li element to accomdate for the new top footer that was added. I made the padding gap smaller so the elements were closer together as the original padding resulted in navigation bar boxes being pushed onto the next line.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Desktop CSS 1012 part 2.png" class="desktopCSS1012-2" alt="Desktop CSS changes made on the 10th of December">
                <p>Lastly I then added the new picture to the CSS, the code for the majority of the pictures at this and later stages is the same so to avoid reptition, from this point onwards I will not be including each image edition unless code has changed.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Default CSS 1012 code set 2 .png" class="defaultCSS1012-2" alt="Second set of changes to the default CSS from December 10th">
                <p>I then reviewed the code that I wrote that day. In my default CSS I then changed my minus margin from earlier. the edition of a wild card meant that there was now only a gap on the left rather than on the top and left. I changed it so now only the minus margin is applied on the left. I didn't want to apply it to all sides in case it resulted in content being cut off the screen.</p>
                <p>I then took my sizes for my image out of the HTML file and adjusted the sizing using CSS instead.I would do this instead for all images from this point onwards.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Mobile CSS 1012.png" class="mobileCSS1012" alt="Started Mobile Static Layout 10th of December">
                <p>I then started making the grid layout for my mobile version of the site. Some of my code is broken within this screenshot. I have redudant code as there is still a header tag present which is not used in the final design. At this point I couldn't figure out why my mobile top bar was not appearing. I tried to comabt this by making the size of the mobile top bar to an extremely larger percentage to see if I could get it draw. Later I realised this was becase I had not assigned a grid area to the mobile top clss so it would not be able to find it and add it to the grid. There was still problems with my grid at this point as I still had sizes set that would override the grid.</p>
                <p>I then set the top footer to display none, this is because this is not used on the mobile version of the site.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Desktop Grid Fix 1012.png" class="desktopCCS1012-3" alt="Trying to fix the grid layout on Desktop CSS">
                <img src="Code Morphology\Mobile fixing grid 1012.png" class="mobileCSSS1012-2" alt="Trying to fix the grid layout on Mobile CSS">
                <p>I then focused on fixing my grid for both version of my sites as I identified this as being the reason my layout was not working as intended. In order to fix part of my grid i removed the hheight on the desktop CSS. Interstingly I did not do this one the mobile css, so the mobile grid at this point would still not work as intended due to the code contrasting. Then I added grid areas to noththe mobile and desktop CSS. This was not tneeded as I had already asigned grid areas to the default CSS. However at the time I did not think of this. These grid areas would evenutually be removed due to the code being redundant.</p>
                <p>In the Desktop CSS i added CSS to make the top fotter display correclty. This involved floating it right so that it is drawn from the right and there is no chance of a gap being on the right betweenthe box and the end of the page. I then fixed the grid area name assigned to it, therefore it will now be added to the grid.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Desktop CSS removed sub menu 1012.png" class="desktopCSS1012-4" alt="Removing the commented sub-menu">
                <p>Lastly in this stage, I decided that I definetly was not going to have a sub-menu on my website, as discussed earlier, therefore I removed commented out sub-menu.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Site Display 1012.png" class="siteDisplay1012" alt="The finalised static display for my desktop site">
                <p> After the above changes, my websites desktop static display was complete and looked like this.</p>

                <p>This is what my mobile site looks like with the above code changes applied to it. There is still a placeholder where the burger menu will be drawn. However at the time I did not do this yet as I wanted to do the mobile navigation all in one session.</p>

                <h3>Grid Development</h3>
                <h4>Written 01/01/2021 </h4>
                <p>Overtime my grid layout changed from the code demonstrated above. This was because as my site became larger I decided to seperate my text into sections to make it easier to read and understand my code.</p>
                <p>The first thing I had to overcome was how to section my website. I had used standard section tags like main and aside for the original grid. Howevver I was not aware of any additional versions of this for if I had more than main or aside. I dedcided I was going to use classes for my next sections. To keep them relevant to the sections I already used I named them numbercially. So instead of main there was now a new class called main-2 that goes directly undeneath main. </p>

                <p>The first time I added extra rows to my code was on the 15th of December, the code above shows how I implemented these extra sections into the default CSS before adding them to the grid. THe second screenshow shows how I ammended the grid layout to get these new sections to display.</p>
                <p>Overtime my grid expanded again to accomdate new content. Including the site report this meant I ended up with nine total sections (one main and eight custom classes).</p>
                <p>I feel like the way I have used grid method was effective and has resulted in a site that is easy to understand in terms of its layout and its code. I feel like the way I have coded my grid means that it is very easy to add new sections to my page that will work as soon as they are added without difficulty. I am pleased with this as this has future proofed my site and means I can come back to my site and add work to it at a later date without being confused how to.</p>
                <p>I feel like there is probabaly a better way to split my site into more sections that the way I have done it, however I could not find any easy answers on how to split my site and I feel like a lot of that is due to their being lots of solutions, with no defintive right answer.</p>

                <h3>Animations Development</h3> 
                <h4>Written 01/01/2021</h4>
                <h4>Code Written 10/12/2020</h4>
                <p>After completing my static layout I started to consider what animations I could add to my site to improve it. When doing my reserach I noted that some sites I looked at use lots of animations. I also noted the same sites that use lots of animations can struggle to load quickly and can be overwhelming. I wanted to avoid this so I decided to pick one area of the site to focus on animating.</p>
                <p>I decided to focus my animations on the navigatione menu as that is where the user is most likely to click and hover over wehn using my site. I decided against animating the main and aside content of my site as it can be annoying and distracting if animations kept occurring while trying to read the sites content.</p> 
                <p>I looked at this book for inspiration on my animations.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Desktop CSS hover.png" class="desktopCSSHover" alt="Code used to change the navigation buttons colour when hovered on">
                <p>The first animation I added changes the colour of the navigation button hovered on. I like this animation as it helps the user understand where the cursor is.</p>
                <p>This animation is simple to code in CSS, it requires a before and after state. The before state being the normal li element and the after state being the :hover attribute. li:hover has one line of code in it which changes the background colour to another colour when the mouse cursor is hovered over. The same code is also applied to the top footer to make it consistent with the navigation bar. </p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Desktop CSS Button Scale .png" class="desktopCSSScale" alt="Code used to make the navigation buttons change size">
                <p>The second animation I added was based on information I sourced from...</p>
                <p>This animation has two steps to it, a transform and a transition. When hovered over the transform enlarges the button to highlight it, achieved by using scale. However if transform was used by itself this change would be sudden, this would look unfinished and jarring for the site users. Therefore a transition is used. The transition allows me to set the speed that the navigation bar goes from the before hover state to the hover state. In this code this is 0.5 seconds. Next to this is the transition method. In this example it is a transition called ease-in-out, this is a transition with a slow beginning and end. This gives the user the impression that the button is coming towards them. </p>

                <h3>Form development and styling</h3>
                <h4>Written 01/01/2021</h4>
                <h4>Code Written 15/12/2020</h4>
                <p>My site uses a form that acts as a button. When this form is pressed it opens the site users email page to a empty email where they can add information to contact me. The final version is just a button so they get sent to a blank email with a filled in subject line. Origianlly I had a more complicated form where the user put there name and email address into the form before pressing submit however this made the email process more complicated than necesssary as well as resulting in a messy email. I felt like this would frustrate the person trying to contact me as they are likely to delete the information they put in using the form and write their own personal email. In the future I would like to explore forms more so I have a better understanding of the range of uses for them.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Creating the Contact Form.png" class="contactFormCode" alt="The code used to create contact me form">
                <img src="Code Morphology\Contact form no styling.png" class="contactFormNS" alt="How the contact form looks at this stage, without any styling applied">
                <img src="Code Morphology\Where Form Takes You To.png" class="contactFormEmail" alt="Where the contact form takes you when it is clicked">
                <p>This form works by having a single input type in it. The forms action is to open a black email to my email adress (emilyfletcher099@gmail.com) with the subject line prefilled with "Personal Website Contact Form". The user themselves can change this but i've filled it in to make the process a little quicker as well as allowing me to know whenever I get an email with that subject line it is from my site. The input inside has the submit type. This means that when interacted with all the information given will be acted on and updated. In this case opening a blank email with my address and subject prefilled. The value assigned is text that displays over this element. In this example it works very similar to a hyperlink that would take you to another page. </p>

                <img src="Code Morphology\Contact form with styling.png" class="contactFormS" alt="What the contact form now looks like with styling">
                <p>At this point my form looked very out of place and bland. Therefore I decided to add CSS styling to it to make it blend in better with my websites layout.</p>
                <p>To style the form I applied CSS to the default CSS. The reason for this is so styling is applied to the from in both the desktop and mobile site. In order to target the form the input tag is used in the CSS rather than giving the form a seperate class. Similar code is used to that of the navigation bar to keep the form consistent with the layout. This includes setting a backgrounf colour, a font that matches, the font colour and giving the form element padding. This padding makes the gap around the text which makes 'the button' larger. This makes it easier to click for mobile users as well as easier to see for all users.</p>

                <h3>Mobile Navigation</h3>
                <h4>Wriiten 01/01/2021</h4>
                <h4>Code Written 15/12/2020</h4>
                <p>I first attempted to make the mobile navigation menu on the 15th of December. However I was not successful in this and got frustrated so I ended up making the mobile menu work on a seperate day.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Index page 1512.png" class="IndexPage1512" alt="Moving the structure of my HTML file">
                <p>The first thing I noticed when I created my mobile menu is that when it is open the images appear infront of it. This is an issue as the menu does not look good as the images obscure the text. The way I fixed this was by moving the location of the navigation bar code in the HTML. This is because HTML is drawn in order so changing the order means that the pictures will be drawn first and therefore will appear underneath the menu.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\CSS Mobile 1512.png" class="mobileCSS1512" alt="Original attempt at burger menu">
                <p>Originally I used an image to make the burger menu, My original intention for this was to make my experience a little easier as I wouldn't have to make a burger menu by hand. However when I did this I couldn't find an image that fitted the description as I wanted it, to keep the image consistent with all my others I added clip path. However this resulted in an image that was stretched and pixelated which did not look professional on my site. I also found it confusing to try and make the mobile menu open and close.</p>                
                <h4>Code Written 18/12/2020</h4>
                <p>The code used for this section was directly inspired by code from my University Lecturer. (Tom Butler, 2020)</p>
                <p>Originally I struggled to understand how to make the mobile menu using just CSS, this is because a lot of material available for mobile menus uses JavaScript which is not part of this assignment. The only method I could find outside of that my lecturer taught me was the checkbox method. However I didn't end up using this as this required a lot more CSS and I felt like it wouldn't work as well as you have to hide a check box behind a burger menu. As the checkbox wouldn't be resizeable then it could be hard to find the exact spot to check the checkbox.</p>
                <p>I struggled to figure out how to fit the code my lecturer taught me into the code I had already written. To improve my understanding of this I made the menu in a seperate fresh set of HTML and CSS files and then copied it back into my website files. This helped my understanding as it allowed me to view my code in isolation.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Nav Test HTML.png" class="navTestHTML" alt="The HTML for my navigation test ">
                <p>The first thing I did in my HTMl is copy my navigation menu over. I didn't copy across any links for the pages as I was not testing whether I could make pages link I was only testing whether I could make a menu that opens and closes.</p>
                <p>The a tag assigns a class called shownav. Shownav is the name for the class that is used to draw the burger menu. It also has ahref on it, this means that when clicked it takes you to a different version of the page. This can be seen on the url of the page as at the end #clicked is added. </p>
                <p>The ID clicked is used on the navigation bar to link it to #clicked. The ahref # is then used to make it targetable. This is important for the CSS.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Nav Test CSS 1.png" class="navTestCSS1" alt="Part one of the CSS for my navigation test menu">
                <p>In the first screenshot of CSS the code to open the menu is demonstrated. Initially the navigation bar is hidden as it should not be on screen until the burger is clicked. Once the navigation is targeted it then draws the burger menu on screen. In this case being targetted means the shownav class is clicked. This refers to clicking the burger menu.</p>
                <p>When the navigation is targeted the navigation menu is shown in a fixed postition, this is so it is drawn overthe top of current objects. This is then sized to 100% of the screens width and height.So it covers thw whole screen. The background of the menu is the same colour as the navigation bar for conistency as well as to hide all the website elements. This is important as the mobile site is still behind the nav menu. The padding and font size is applied to the navigation bar to spread out the text and make the font bigger. This is done so that the links are clickable within the menu. Top 0 is needed in this code to make the menu fill the screen. Without top 0 the navigation bar does not reach the top and part of the burger is visible. </p>
                <p>In this example I have set the body of the test to the background colour black. This is because I wanted a white mobile burger icon. If I did not make the background black then I would not see what I have drawn in the next step.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Nav Test CSS 2.png" class="navTestCSS2" alt="Part two of the CSS for my navigaiton test menu">
                <p>Within show nav is the code to draw the top and bottom line of the burger menu. This works by drawing a transparent object with a height and width. Then a border is added to the transparent shape at the top and bottom to make two solid lines of the burger menu. Shownav: before is used to draw the bottom line. the :before is used so it draws the line relative to the shownav and so I do not have to add extra HTML for the line. As I needed to draw another element the content is '', this is because you can't have an empty content box but it is needed for the :before and :after CSS. Position absolute is used here to place the line relative to the other border lines. This is acceptable here as this icon is not always on screen. The width is the same as the shownav so the third line is the same length. The position absolute draws the third line at the top of the screen. To move this down to the right position I moved the position 3.5em from the top. I then had to move it 8px left as it didn't draw the :before at the same indent as the shownav. Lastly I added a border to the top of the object to draw the third white line. </p>

                <img src="Code Morphology\Nav Test Final.png" class="navTestFinal" alt="What the mobile menu looks like in the test document.">
                <p>This is what the menu on the test looks like when the burger menu is opened. It is important to consider not all the code in the test is the same as the final site, this is why the right fonts aren't being used and why there is text and list decoration on the menu.</p>

                <img src="Code Morphology\Final Mobile Menu Open.png" class="mobileMenuOpen" alt="What my mobile menu looks like when the burger is clicked and the menu is open">
                <p>Once I knew my test version of the menu was working correctly I copied the code over to my final site. The images above show the final burger icon on the mobile site and what the burger opens to once it is clicked.</p>

                <h3>Comments, Code Fixes and Conclusion</h3>
                <h4>Comments</h4>
                <p>I have used comments on all my HTMl files and all my CSS files, these are used for two main reasons whithin my project. Reason one is to explain how my code works this is for my benefit as well as others, it will help me in the future when I come back to improve or add to my website, as well as help others know how my code works and that I understand how it is written. The second reason for my comments is to add citations. These citations credit those whose work I used to make elements of my page work. I may have used there work in its origianl form or been obviously heavily influenced by there work, therfore it would be plagarism if I did not cite them. The reason I sited them in my code as well as my report is so those reviewing my code can see where I directly used that code.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\HTML Comments .png" class="commentsHTML" alt="Example of comments I have used in my HTML">
                <img src="Code Morphology\CSS comments.png" class="commentsCSS" alt="Example of comments I have used in my CSS">
                <p>Above are examples of my comments in both CSS and HTMl.</p>
                <h4>Written 03/01/2021</h4>
                <h4>Code Fixes</h4>
                <h4>Written 03/01/2021</h4>
                <p>A lot of problems I identified were fixed as I went along and at the time used trial and error to fix them. However there was a few specific dates where I went through my code and removed redudant code.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Code Fix 1012.png" class="codeFix1012" alt="Fixing Code 10/12/2020">
                <p>The first example of a specific time where I looked for inefficent or broken code being the 10th of Decemeber. On this screen shot from that date I removed code from the Desktop CSS that was already in the Default CSS. I did this to neaten up my code as the code I removed was repeated and therefore doing the same thing as the defualt CSS.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Code Fix 1812.png" class="codeFix1812" alt="Fixing Code 18/12/2020">
                <img src="Code Morphology\Code Fix 1812-2.png" class="codeFix1812-2" alt="Fixing Code 18/12/2020">
                <p>The next time I would review my code properly would be the 18th of December. In example one I removed redudant code like the float:right, origianlly I thought this was keep them top-footer at the end of the website, however because inline-block was being used on the nav bar then this was also making sure that the top-footer was on the top right. Therfore I no longer neeed the float right. The second example is me re-ordering some of my code to maintain a better consistency. The majority of my code is organised in a way so that elements that are repated often are in the same location within each tag. This makes my code easier to read as I know roughly to expect below and above it. This is good for troubleshooting as it allows me to quickly see if I have missed a line of code if there is a simialr element to compare it to, such as images. It also helps me maintain a mindset of being able to break things down in my code. For example I know that if I add an image then I need to set the shape, size and width first, then I can thing about shadows and borders and lastly about positioning.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Code Fix 2812.png" class="codeFix2812" alt="Fixing Code 28/12/2020">
                <p>Not happy with just having two revisions I then revisted my code on the 28th of December, this time I removed more redudant code relating to my grids. I noticed that I had grid areas assigned on my mobile, desktop and default CSS. If they were on my default CSS then they did not need to be on my mobile and desktop CSS. This is because no matter what the screen size the default CSS is always applied to the HTML, therefore the grid areas on mobile and desktop were not needed. Therefore they were removed.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Code Fix 2912.png" class="codeFix2912" alt="Fixing Code 29/12/2020">
                <p>Lastly on the 29th of December I swapped all my a tags relating grid sections to div tags. There is no physcial difference to the websites appearance from this, however the change does make my code easier to understand. A tags are suppossed to be used for links and divides are used for splitting up a site. Therefore it was more appropriate for my sections to use divs than a's.</p>
                <p>There was a lot more smaller fixes that I demonstrated along the way earlier in my code morphology, however the above were specific dates where I delibrately looked for errors within my code.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <h4>Written 03/01/2021</h4>
                <p>The above has demonstrated my coding development over the course of this assignment. I feel like by the time I have reached the end of this report my coding ability has improved a lot compared to where I started from. There was a lot of small mistakes throughout my code, a lot of them I fixed along the way. I am sure for definte that some I will have missed. However I do not see this as a bad thing. There will always be a few errors within someones work and I believe I have made a good effort to find as many as possible. For my first proper coding project I am pleased with my coding standard. I look forward to looking back on this piece of work in the future and seeing areas for improvement.</p>
