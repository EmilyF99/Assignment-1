                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <h4>Written 03/01/2021</h4>
                <p>The last part of my site report covers my Github useage and validating my final code. It is important to evaluate my Github useage as that is my version control method. I need to have a good version control method incase I break my code and delete something I need in the future. Good version control will allow me to compare my old code to my new code as well as rolling my code back to the last working verison. Validation is important as it checks for syntax errors, syntax errors can be easily missed by programmers and can cause my page to not display correctly. </p>

                <h3>Github Useage</h3>
                <h4>Written 03/01/2021</h4>
                <p>I used Github for version control of my website, reflectively I think that my Github use could be a lot better than it is currently.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Github .png" class="github" alt="Number of commits used">
                <p>I am pleased with the amount of commits in my project. I think it is good that I have a large amount of commits as it gives me lots of versions of my code to choose from should somehting go wrong. This allows me to roll my code back to a version before with only small amounts of code changes, this means I wouldn't lose a lot of work if this happened and I wouldn't have to spend as much time to get back to the stage I was before my code broke. Having lots of frequent commits also means if I do have to roll back to an earlier version it is more than likely only to fix a singular problem this means there is a smaller risk of me missing some code I had before the roll back and then becoming frustrated because I cannot figure out what has changed between versions.</p>
                <p>However having many commits is only effecitve if they are well named. They need to be well named so it is easy to find specific pieces of code I am looking for.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Github branch number.png" class="githubBN" alt="The amount of branches used in my Github">
                <p>Reflectively my branch use was poor. I intially tried to make branches for each page I made, however I became confused and merged them all into one master branch. Out of all my areas for improvement I would highlight Github as a main improvment area as branches are really important to know about when it comes to version control. I definetly could have saved time by having multiple branches and merging them, rather than having only one branch. </p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Github Commits development.png" class="githubCD" alt="How my commit titles looked at the start of my project">
                <img src="Code Morphology\Github Commits development 2.png" class="githubCD-2" alt="How my commit titles improved over the project">
                <p>When I first started my project my commit names were vague and not very good. There titles were similar and did nto really tell me what changes were made. As shown in the first screenshot.</p>
                <p>The second screenshot shows some of my commits later on. I think these commits are much better than the first screenshot as the titles are clear, in my opinion, on what ahs changed and the commits appear to be much more frequent in terms of the small amount of changes made. </p>
                <p>I believe that my Github use has improved over time and these two screenshots clearly show that.</p>
                <img src="Code Morphology\Commit typography errors.png" class="githubErrors" alt="typography errors within my Github">
                <p>Some of my commits have typography errors within them. This in my opinion does not look good, and while it is an easy mistake, it can result in my work looking unprofessional and rushed. A improvement for the future would be to take more care with my commit titles and my typography. </p>
