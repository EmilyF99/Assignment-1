                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <h4>Written 21/12/2020</h4>
                <p>The following section will cover the design delevlopment of the websites. This will cover the market research I did to help me come up with design ideas. Then I will show my wireframes that I designed based on my market reserach and discuss the selected design in more detail. Then I will discuss the colour scheme and fonts I chose for the final design. Lastly I will compare and evaluate the final website against the design I initially created.</p>

                <h3>Market Research</h3>
                <h4>Written 07/11/2020</h4> 
                <p>I am going to be looking at websites that are specifically portfolio websites, this is because this is what I am going to be making so it makes sense to draw inspiration from that. </p>
                <p>While doing my market research I am also going to look at common website builders. The reason I am doing this is because part of the assignment brief asks for a unique design. Website building sites use the most common designs and templates that most people are likely to see. Researching this should hopefully mean I don’t accidently copy these templates. However, it does not mean I should completely avoid these templates. There must be good elements in these default templates otherwise they would not be popular.</p>
                <h4>Examples for Website Builders</h4>
                <p>Example From GoDaddy</p>

                <h4>Common Features Across Website Builders</h4>
                <p>A lot of these Website Builders seem to revolve around a similar layout. Most of the website builders I looked at included different layouts as well as these, but these are the most popular designs. The main consistent feature of these website is that they have one main image that is the draw point and focus of the site. Then they tend to have the content of the site below this. The user has to scroll past the image to gain access to the rest of the site. They tend to all have a navigation bar along top of the site and a title to the left of the page. There tends to be a few buttons on the site and not much use of animations. The mobile versions of the site all have burger menus which tend to be very simple in design.</p>
                <p>I’ve learnt that a lot of people tend to aim towards similar layouts in website builders. This is because this layout is very standard and easy to read as it is not very cluttered. I should consider this when designing my own website. However, I also do not want to replicate this style completely as complete replication will result in my site looking bland and not interesting. It could also then be mistaken for a design that was made on a website builder. This is something I want to especially avoid as I want to showcase what I can make I HTML and CSS.</p>
                <h4>Example from Portolio Websites</h4>
                <img src="Portfolio Mobile Menu Example.png" class="portfolio-desktop-main" alt="Personal Portfolio Mobile Menu Example">
                <img src="Portfolio Mobile Main Example.png" class="portfolio-mobile-main" alt="Personal Portfolio Mobile Main Content Example">
                <img src="Portfolio Desktop Main Example.png" class="portfolio-mobile-menu" alt="Personal Portfolio Mobile Menu Example">
                <p>Loading was quick, all the website loaded at once and there was no hang ups on the site, didn’t have to wait for any additional content to load. Small hang when clicking on the burger menu and hourglass search icon as the resulting animation draws across the screen.</p>
                <p>Font: Overall, the font used was good. The sizing of the font was large making it easy to read an making it stand out, the font style was very streamlined and a lot of bold was used. This is effective as well as helping to prevent content overload for the user. 
                Colours:Block colours were used to make an effective stand out design. They help separate the content on the page. This prevents the reader from reading large blocks of text and getting bored. Making the page engaging. 
                Sizing:Something about the sizing doesn’t feel right about the sight. Things feel like they don’t fit on the screen properly in terms of element size, this is especially apparent on the mobile version where things feel like they were squished to make fit. Gives the impression that size consideration was overlooked or an afterthought.
                Ease to Navigate: Site is very easy to read and navigate. All links have subsequent back links, no risk of getting stuck on a page. 
                Engagement: Site uses animations as the main way to keep users engaged, however small frequent images are often used throughout the site as well as small amounts of text
                Layout:Grid based layout, even spaced apart with the grid having one or two columns. Easy to look at and more effective than one block colour.</p>
                <p>Lots of animation present on this website, these animations were small and related to the content on the page at the time. This gave the feeling that each animation was purposeful and selected for a reason. The majority of the animation worked upon hovering over elements. Specific examples included text moving away from the cursor, and images having a slight zoom to them. Looping animations such as work demonstration, used to demonstrate Java Script Projects. Clickable animations such as a burger menu and search features.</p>
                <p>Lots of features to click on the site with. Large majority of the page is clickable and loads internal pages or external links to projects the author worked on </p>
                <p>Website version is very similar to the mobile design. This is good for consistency but not for optimisation as text does not always display as it should on the mobile version. Number of columns is reduced to one.</p>
                <p>Code uses lots of JavaScript which is not being used in this project. So, looking at the Source Code hasn’t really helped to improve understanding.The layout of the code is poor. Elements are split into Div tags which is poor practice as it makes the code hard to read and inaccessible for screen reading software. Lines of code also lacks some indentation making nested elements hard to identify. Classes are used on the majority of elements which can make code harder to read and result in lots of extra time being made on creating classes. No spacing between code, this makes it harder to read and understand what is grouped together.</p>
                <h4>General Findings</h4>
                <p>After searching for portfolio websites there is a lot of consistent features that make websites stand out from others. I’ve noted that certain colours seem to do better at maintaining focus. These tend to be websites that have a muted or pale colour tone with the occasional pop of colour to them. The pale and muted colours make the sites easy to read without hurting the readers eyes and the pop of colour acts as a focus point. The most effective websites I’ve personally seen tend to use bright colours only for the navigation or interactive parts of the website they want you to click, I believe this is done to have a influence on how the user will navigate the site,  almost giving the user a path to take. 
                    I have also noticed the most interesting websites tend to have large elements that pop at the user, these tend to be clickable and very simple in design. These tend to appeal to the writer personally, so a simple and clean design is an objective. The same goes for the text. Large fonts without serifs are consistent across the research therefore a similar approach should be used.
                    However, some sites used were quite performance heavy and when multi-tasking with different programs and web-browsers open they became quite frustrating to view and work with. This result in choppy animations and page hang ups. The cause of this issue results from being bombarded with animations, this frustration led to the wanting to click away from the website without absorbing the content. This is not ideal and something the writer wants to avoid at all costs.</p>

                <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                <h4>Written 16/11/20</h4>
                <p>I made quick wireframes of potetnional designs for my websiite. I did this because I wanted to know roughly where I was going to put elements before I started to code. This was to prvent me from creating a design that was cluttered as well as minmising the risk of me starting a design and then not liking the result and having to start again. I think my wireframes were effective as they helped me plan what animations I could have as well as helping give me ideas on what dimensions and positioning I would need before making the website. It also helped me to visualise my design as looking at a blank page can be overwhelming when trying to design something in your head, wdith Wireframes I have had something to refer back to and inspire me.</p>
