                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <h4>Written 21/12/2020</h4>
                <p>The following section will cover the design delevlopment of the websites. This will cover the market research I did to help me come up with design ideas. Then I will show my wireframes that I designed based on my market reserach and discuss the selected design in more detail. Then I will discuss the colour scheme and fonts I chose for the final design. Lastly I will compare and evaluate the final website against the design I initially created.</p>

                <h3>Market Research</h3>
                <h4>Written 07/11/2020</h4> 
                <h4>Added to site 21/12/2020</h4>
                <p>I am going to be looking at websites that are specifically portfolio websites, this is because this is what I am going to be making so it makes sense to draw inspiration from that. </p>
                <p>While doing my market research I am also going to look at common website builders. The reason I am doing this is because part of the assignment brief asks for a unique design. Website building sites use the most common designs and templates that most people are likely to see. Researching this should hopefully mean I don’t accidently copy these templates. However, it does not mean I should completely avoid these templates. There must be good elements in these default templates otherwise they would not be popular.</p>
                <h4>Examples for Website Builders</h4>
                <p>Example From GoDaddy</p>

                <h4>Common Features Across Website Builders</h4>
                <p>A lot of these Website Builders seem to revolve around a similar layout. Most of the website builders I looked at included different layouts as well as these, but these are the most popular designs. The main consistent feature of these website is that they have one main image that is the draw point and focus of the site. Then they tend to have the content of the site below this. The user has to scroll past the image to gain access to the rest of the site. They tend to all have a navigation bar along top of the site and a title to the left of the page. There tends to be a few buttons on the site and not much use of animations. The mobile versions of the site all have burger menus which tend to be very simple in design.</p>
                <p>I’ve learnt that a lot of people tend to aim towards similar layouts in website builders. This is because this layout is very standard and easy to read as it is not very cluttered. I should consider this when designing my own website. However, I also do not want to replicate this style completely as complete replication will result in my site looking bland and not interesting. It could also then be mistaken for a design that was made on a website builder. This is something I want to especially avoid as I want to showcase what I can make I HTML and CSS.</p>
                <h4>Example from Portolio Website</h4>
                <img src="Portfolio Mobile Menu Example.png" class="portfolio-desktop-main" alt="Personal Portfolio Mobile Menu Example">
                <img src="Portfolio Mobile Main Example.png" class="portfolio-mobile-main" alt="Personal Portfolio Mobile Main Content Example">
                <img src="Portfolio Desktop Main Example.png" class="portfolio-desktop-menu" alt="Personal Portfolio Mobile Menu Example">
                <p>Loading was quick, all the website loaded at once and there was no hang ups on the site, didn’t have to wait for any additional content to load. Small hang when clicking on the burger menu and hourglass search icon as the resulting animation draws across the screen.</p>
                <p>Font: Overall, the font used was good. The sizing of the font was large making it easy to read an making it stand out, the font style was very streamlined and a lot of bold was used. This is effective as well as helping to prevent content overload for the user. 
                Colours:Block colours were used to make an effective stand out design. They help separate the content on the page. This prevents the reader from reading large blocks of text and getting bored. Making the page engaging. 
                Sizing:Something about the sizing doesn’t feel right about the sight. Things feel like they don’t fit on the screen properly in terms of element size, this is especially apparent on the mobile version where things feel like they were squished to make fit. Gives the impression that size consideration was overlooked or an afterthought.
                Ease to Navigate: Site is very easy to read and navigate. All links have subsequent back links, no risk of getting stuck on a page. 
                Engagement: Site uses animations as the main way to keep users engaged, however small frequent images are often used throughout the site as well as small amounts of text
                Layout:Grid based layout, even spaced apart with the grid having one or two columns. Easy to look at and more effective than one block colour.</p>
                <p>Lots of animation present on this website, these animations were small and related to the content on the page at the time. This gave the feeling that each animation was purposeful and selected for a reason. The majority of the animation worked upon hovering over elements. Specific examples included text moving away from the cursor, and images having a slight zoom to them. Looping animations such as work demonstration, used to demonstrate Java Script Projects. Clickable animations such as a burger menu and search features.</p>
                <p>Lots of features to click on the site with. Large majority of the page is clickable and loads internal pages or external links to projects the author worked on </p>
                <p>Website version is very similar to the mobile design. This is good for consistency but not for optimisation as text does not always display as it should on the mobile version. Number of columns is reduced to one.</p>
                <p>Code uses lots of JavaScript which is not being used in this project. So, looking at the Source Code hasn’t really helped to improve understanding.The layout of the code is poor. Elements are split into Div tags which is poor practice as it makes the code hard to read and inaccessible for screen reading software. Lines of code also lacks some indentation making nested elements hard to identify. Classes are used on the majority of elements which can make code harder to read and result in lots of extra time being made on creating classes. No spacing between code, this makes it harder to read and understand what is grouped together.</p>
                <h4>General Findings</h4>
                <p>After searching for portfolio websites there is a lot of consistent features that make websites stand out from others. I’ve noted that certain colours seem to do better at maintaining focus. These tend to be websites that have a muted or pale colour tone with the occasional pop of colour to them. The pale and muted colours make the sites easy to read without hurting the readers eyes and the pop of colour acts as a focus point. The most effective websites I’ve personally seen tend to use bright colours only for the navigation or interactive parts of the website they want you to click, I believe this is done to have a influence on how the user will navigate the site,  almost giving the user a path to take. 
                    I have also noticed the most interesting websites tend to have large elements that pop at the user, these tend to be clickable and very simple in design. These tend to appeal to the writer personally, so a simple and clean design is an objective. The same goes for the text. Large fonts without serifs are consistent across the research therefore a similar approach should be used.
                    However, some sites used were quite performance heavy and when multi-tasking with different programs and web-browsers open they became quite frustrating to view and work with. This result in choppy animations and page hang ups. The cause of this issue results from being bombarded with animations, this frustration led to the wanting to click away from the website without absorbing the content. This is not ideal and something the writer wants to avoid at all costs.</p>

                <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                <h4>Written 16/11/2020</h4>
                <h4>Added to site 23/12/2020</h4>
                <p>I made quick wireframes of potetnional designs for my websiite. I did this because I wanted to know roughly where I was going to put elements before I started to code. This was to prvent me from creating a design that was cluttered as well as minmising the risk of me starting a design and then not liking the result and having to start again. I think my wireframes were effective as they helped me plan what animations I could have as well as helping give me ideas on what dimensions and positioning I would need before making the website. It also helped me to visualise my design as looking at a blank page can be overwhelming when trying to design something in your head, wdith Wireframes I have had something to refer back to and inspire me.</p>
                <h4>Desktop Design 1</h4>
                <img src="Wireframes Desktop 1.png" class="wireframe-D-1" alt="Desktop Wireframe Design 1">
                <p>This design uses two columns on grid, the left having a round image to draw focus and the main being on the right. There is a nav bar on the top of the website that when hovered on it a border appears and a drop down menu with more information about the page appears.</p>
                <h4>Desktop Design 2</h4>
                <img src="Wireframes Desktop 2.png" class="wireframe-D-2" alt="Desktop Wireframe Design 2">
                <p>This design uses a traditional layout with a heading and a subheading at the top, then there is a nav bar like the last design, when hovered on a small box appears underneath to give more detail about the page, this doesn't cover the whole screen like the last page so you can still view the main content. The main content of this page has a tile like design so the content is clearly seperated and easy to distinguish between.</p>
                <h4>Desktop Design 3</h4>
                <img src="Wireframes Desktop 3.png" class="wireframe-D-3" alt="Desktop Wireframe Design 3">
                <p>This design differs from the first two as the navigation bar is vertically on the right side of the screen, the content is displayed the same way as the first design, when hovered over the images from the aside (represented by the circle) disapper and a short summary box appears.I like the vertical design but it always being on the screen could be an issue as it could result in a cluttered site.</p>
                <h4>Mobile Design 1</h4>
                <img src="Wireframes Mobile 1.png" class="wireframe-M-1" alt="Mobile Wireframe Design 1">
                <p>This design has a traditional burger menu at the top, then to the left of that is an extra button that is used to return to the home page. When the burger menu is opened a simple menu appears with large text with a seperate go back bottom at the bottom.</p>
                <h4>Mobile Design 2</h4>
                <img src="Wireframes Mobile 2.png" class="wireframe-M-2" alt="Mobile Wireframe Design 2">
                <p>This design encorprates the tile design from the second design used for the dekstop. Instead of having two buttons at the top there is once button that is centred and used for the burger menu. When the top button is clicked a burger menu open to half the side of the screen with half of the main content still displayed.</p>
                <h4>Mobile Design 3</h4>
                <img src="Wireframes Mobile 3.png" class="wireframe-M-3" alt="Mobile Wireframe Design 3">
                <p>This design uses one button for the burger menu, however this has been replaced with a plus icon, I have seen some sites that use pluses instead of a burger menu, so i thought I would try this idea as well, this idea aslo uses a half screen menu like the design before. </p>

                <h3>Final Wireframe</h3>
                <h4>Written 16/11/2020</h4>
                <h4>Added to site 23/12/2020</h4>
                <p>Below is the design for my final website, I have tried to encorporate what I think is the best elements from each design into the wireframe. There is a static picture and then a picture with grey to demonstrate the animations used on the site.</p>
                <img src="Final Wireframe-Page-1.png" class="final-wireframe1" alt="Final Wireframe for Desktop">
                <img src="Final Wireframe-Page-2.png" class="final-wireframe2" alt="Final Wireframe for Desktop with animation">
                <img src="Final Wireframe-Page-3.png" class="final-wireframe3" alt="Final Wireframe for Mobile">
                <img src="Final Wireframe-Page-4.png" class="final-wireframe4" alt="Final Wireframe for Mobile with animation">
                <p>For the desktop version of the site I have used the main design from my first idea. I liked all three ways of doing the main in my design, however I picked the first design as it will not become cluttered when large amounts of text are added to the site, this is especially important when making the mobile version of the site. I think using a tile method could result in a cluttered final site. The nav bar is a simple set of buttons that are set apart with blank space inbetween, this is to make the buttons easy to click and to make it easier to differentiate between the buttons. As well as making the desin simple to avoid clutter I have also made it simple to emulate a business card, this is because I want those viewing my site to remember the key parts of my site rather than overloading them with information, I want to make a good inital impact on my site users. When the navigation bar is hovered over a border is drawn around the box to help highlight where your cursor is and a sub-menu is drawn underneath to give more information about the page about to be clicked. I decided against a vertical navigation bar like in design three as I persoanlly feel like design three could make the site look very cluttered and not well thought through, although it would have been  unique.</p>
                <p>The mobile version of the site is consistent with the desktop version in terms of the main style, with a picture on the left aside and a main on the right. There is a top bar across the top to add contrast to the site, this draws the users attention to the burger menu, this replaces the navigation bar. When clicked the screen is replaced by a menu of the same colour as the top bar with large text that can be clicked to take you to that page. The font is large so that it is easy click for mobile users and unlikely to have a misclick. Originally I was going to have two buttons on the top bar, however I have changed that too one to minmise confusion when navigating the website for users as well as to avoid cluttering the mobile site incase users are viewing the final product on an older, smaller smartphone.</p>

                <h3>Colour Scheme and Font Choice</h3>
                <h4>Written 26/12/2020</h4>
                <h4>Colour Scheme</h4>
                <img src="Colour Pallette 1.png" class="colour-pallete-1" alt="First Colour Pallette Used">
                <img src="Colour Pallette 2.png" class="colour-pallete-2" alt="Second Colour Pallette Used">
                <p>I used two colour pallettes on my website, I merged elements of both together to make a colour pallete that suits my needs. I originally used colours all from the colour scheme She is French, Yes? (circuscarnival, 2007). However I didn't like the colour I used from this pallete for the background. Therefore I looked for a similar pallette that had a similar main colour. I used the main colour from Purple Coffee (joy_of_summer,2009) as this was slightly more muted than the other pallette.</p>
                <p>I wanted a muted main colour for my site, this is because muted colours are easier to read from than brighter colours or complicated patterns. Sites that are hard to read are not engaging and could result in users leaving my site before reading its content. I then wanted the navigation bar to contrast this to draw attention to it. I wanted to draw attention to the navigation bar as that is the main element that users will need to use to navigate. If users did not see how to navigate the site then they would get frustrated and leave the site quickly without exploring its content.</p>
                <h4>Font Choices</h4>
                <p>I used Google Fonts to source my fonts for this project. I used Google fonts because they have a large range of fonts and because a lot of fonts on their are used by many sites it means that there's a high chance the user will already have my websites fonts installed. This means the user wont have to install them on computer to use. I've picked two fonts to use. I didn't want to use to many fonts as that can be confusing for the user and would result in a site that looked messy and difficult to read. I picked two fonts, one as a main font and a seperate font for the navigation bar. The main font is used for everything apart from the navigation bar so the website is consistent and professional. I used a seperate font in the navigation bar to help it stand out and draw attention to it. I wanted users to focus on that part so they are drawn to explore the site. </p>
                <p>I used Poppins as the main font, I used this font because its large round letters and its lack of serifs make it easy to read even on small devices. I used Roboto Slab for the navigation bar, I decided to use a font that was the direct opposite of Poppins to make it stand out from it. Therefore I made sure to pick a serif font. I also picked a font with minimal letter spacing, I decided to do this as the navigation buttons needed to fit in one row and large letter spacing could result in larger buttons that may not fit into one row.</p>

                <h3>Final Website Design Evaluation and References</h3>
                <h4>Written 28/12/2020</h4>
                <h4>Final Design Compared to Wireframe</h4>
                <img src="Final Wireframe-Page-1.png" class="wireframe-eval1" alt="Desktop Index Page Wireframe">
                <img src="Final Wireframe-Page-3.png" class="wireframe-eval2" alt="Mobile Index Page Wireframe">
                <img src="Final Desktop Index page.png" class="final-design1" alt="Desktop Index Page Final Design">
                <img src="Final Mobile Index Page .png" class="final-design2" alt="Mobile Index Page Final Design">
                <p>Overall I think my website is fairly consistent with my wireframe. However there is a few differences from my wireframe. I added a extra textbox next to the navigation bar. This was because I thought the navigation bar stretched all the way across made the site look a little empty. I added website credits in this box and where to find my work on GitHub. I needed to have credits somewhere on my website as I did not have a footer and withut credits its hard to know who made the original site. I also thought it was important to have this box so if I ever update the site in the future I could add the version to this box. I feel that with this box the site looks neater than before and helps to spot the coloumns in the website.</p>
                <p>My animations also differ from the original wireframe. Originally I had just a border that appeared when hovered over the navigation bar. This did not look good when I added the box shadow to the buttons. Therefore I instead changed it so the buttons change size and colour when they are hovered over. I am glad I made this change as I feel like these animations are more suited and draws more attention to the users cursor than a border would.</p>
                <p>My wireframe and final design for my mobile design matches, I am pleased with this as I liked the simplicity of the mobile design and I am pleased that I have managed to maintain consistency.</p>
                <h4>Evaulation</h4>
                <p>From the above I have detailed how my website design has progressed overtime. I am pleased with how I developed my design and feel like my design was thought through and good for my current stage in my Computing Course. Overtime I would like to return to this project and develop it as my skills progress. In order to show my improvement in website design I would like to add an archive page so I can archive my old designs and therefore compare my development overtime.I feel like my site is easy to read, works well and is inviting for users to use.</p>
