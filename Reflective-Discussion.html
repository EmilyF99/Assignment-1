                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <h4>Written 18/12/2020</h4>
                <p>The following is a personal reflection on my experience making this website.</p>
                <p>This is the one of the first projects I have coded, it is the first project I have made using HTML and CSS. In that respect I think this project has gone quite well and I have been successful in my task of making a portfolio website.</p>
            </main>
            <div class="main-2">
                <h3>Thoughts</h3>
                <h4>Written 18/12/2020</h4>
                <p>My overall thoughts on this project is that it was a success.</p>
                <p>I have mostly felt positive throughout this project and managed to create this project without too much difficulty.However I do think I have made the project to the best of my abilites and to the reach of my knowledge.</p>
                <p>I think my website has achieved my main goal, to make a professional looking website within my abilities.</p>
                <p>I believe that I have coded and commented in a way that means in the future I will be able to come back to this project and expand it in the future.</p>
                <p>I think I have managed to show a range of skills in website creation with this website as I have used grids, forms, classes, transform, transition, and Id's.However I do think that I could have used Forms more efficently. My form is currently short as it only uses a submit button to externally link to Gmail.</p>
                <p>I do think if I had more time I could have been more creative with some elements of this project, such as making my own images and graphics rather than taking some from Google.</p>
                <p>I think my layout and design for this website was effective, I was going for a portfolio business card type of effect and I feel like this has been achieved well.The reason I think this is because the text is not clutured on the website and it is not tiring to read, this was achieved by sepearting text and making more pages than defined on the brief. </p>
            </div>

                <h3>Feelings</h3>
                <h4>Written 18/12/2020</h4>
                <p>I feel a lot more confident with my coding skills than I did before. Before I felt like I may not have the skills to complete this project due to lack of coding experience.</p>
                <p>The reason I feel more confident is because I noticed that the more I worked on the website the faster my coding abilities became implying that I was developing a better understanding and therefore able to work faster. This is clearly evidenced in GitHub as overtime you can see that in a day I manage to achieve much more work in a smaller time frame compared to previous days before.</p>
                <p>I also feel like my ability has improved a when I went over my work to add addtional comments, during this process I was able to fine and remove lots of reduant code that was either not used or created actions that worked against each other.</p>
                <p>Reflectively while I acknowledged that the project was within my abilities there was a few times I was frustrated with the project. This was mainly around trying to get the mobile menu to work using CSS, I found this task particularly difficult and solved it using trial and error ratherh than understanding what should be classed and what shouldn't.  </p>
                <p>I also feel like I need to review the lecturers content in regards to GitHub, this is because I didn't use branches when making my commits. Some may argue because this website is quite small in sizes of code that it is not necessaryto make branches however I do see the use of them. I tried to make branches on my inital commits however I made a mistake in how I was using them and they wan't working correctly so they were deleted and I didn't realise until I was quite a few comments into my work.</p>
                <p>I feel like my website is fairly easy to navigate and use. This was due to it's simple style and layout. I feel like I could have been more creative with my website, however this may have had the consequence of making it harder to use</p>
                <p>I feel like the design of my website is good in terms of font useage, I feel like the fonts I picked from Google fonts are wasy to read and appropriate in terms of size. I chose a serif font for the navigation bar to make it stand out from the main content of the site and to give it a more traditional look (Roboto-Slab). However I think the use of the Poppins font for the main content was a good decision as it was Sans-serif which makes it easier to read in general, especially in a smaller size and in a block of text, which was it's main use.</p>

                <h3>Evaluation</h3>
                <h4>Written 21/12/2020</h4>
                <p>Overall I think my website is effective at what it sets out to do.</p>
                <p>It aims to be a semi-professional website that I can use and develop as my personal portfolio. It also has scondary aims of being easy to navigate and access as well as helping me develop my programming and website development skills. While I personally acknowledge that not everything will be perfect with the site I believe it works within a good standard for my current level.</p>
                <p>I believe I have met the briefs given requirements, this includes having specific pages within the website as well as having a working burger menu that only displays on the moible version of the site.</p>
                <p>I also believe I have met additional requirements from the brief, I think this because my site is responsive and adjusts to the screen window. The text spreads across the screen and positioning changes to fit the screen.I also believe it meets these requirements as the site has a consistent style throughout all of its pages. It also has a completely working navigation bar and uses animations throughout it's design.</p>
                <p>I also think that my code meets the brief's technical requirements, I think I have used tags appropriately throughout the code and limited using classes where possible to instead use relevant tags such as nav and aside tags, I think the way I have named classes meets standard HTML and CSS conventions and it is clear on the tags purpose. I have avoided HTML style tags as they are bad practice and have avoided using IDs as they are also bad practice as they can only be used once </aside> </p>

                <h3>Improvements</h3>
                <h4>Written 18/12/2020</h4>
                <p>As mentioned before I feel like I could review my use of GitHub, while I feel like my commits were good and overtime the titles improved I do think I could have used branches to tidy up my commits. This would be my main improvement if I was to do this project again.</p>
                <p>If I had longer to work on this project, I would consider addinng personal images and graphics to my project to personalise it a bit more to myself and to avoid any risk of copyright issues, using personal issues would also help improve the professionalism of the site.</p>
                <p> In the future I will need to update this site and add more content to it. I could see the CV page and the Projects page needing updating frequently as I make more projects over the course of my career as well as gaining more work related experience.</p>
                <p>I could consider adding additional style sheets to my work, especially a stylesheet for a printable version of the website. My current website is not very printableand would waste a lot of ink to print it out, it could be handy to have a printable version in case I wanted to use it in a paperbased portfolio, or if anyone using my portfolio wanedto be able to print my work history. </p>
                <p>I feel like I could improve my site by making it more accessible. I feel like it currretly my website is screen reader friendly as I have used alternate text for images which screen readers can read and I split sections up to stop larage chunks all being read at once. I could make my site more accessible in the future by adding a stylesheet for people who are colour blind, giving a "large mode" to increae font size for people who struggle to read smaller text as well as possibly offering more language choices</p>
                <p>Currently my website uses the default Icon on the tab bar. I feel like this is boring and doesn't make it stand out, it also means that when the site is pinned in a browser you don't have a way to tell what site is pinned without clicking on it. I feel like adding icon would do a lot to make my site look more professional.</p>
                <p>I could improve the impressive effect my site could have be adding more animation, a lot of the sites I saw during personal research has a  lot of animation on them to wow the user and to make the sites memorable. However it is important to remember there is animation limitatins within CSS and personal limitaitons due to a knowledge gap that I have. If I was to add more animations it would be important to consider site performance as too many animations could make the site unresponsive for some users which can be frustrating</p>
                <p>To make my site more interesting and show a better technical ability I could add videos to the site. At the momement I dont have any work that jusitifies adding a video but in the future I will, the code for adding a video is slightly different to the code I have used so far so it would show a larger range in my work.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <h4>Written 21/12/2020</h4>
                <p>Overall I am pleased with my work within this module, I think the work that I have done is to the expected standard for my first year at university, I feel like this project was a good learning experience for me as I feel like I have learn lots about HTML and CSS, this will be beneficial for me as I could see myself creating other projects in HTML and CSS. Overall I think I understand my code, this means I could replicate a similar website for a different purpose with the same skill.I would be happy to work on another project like this and am looking forward to being able to expand this website and link it to my GitHub</p>
